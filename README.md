# C_plus_plus-Labs-Programs-
This Project is basically helpful for all college student who faces some problem in their C++ program , kindly refer this here i provide atmost all program of C++ which should be taught to a college student especially a beginner.

### I had not uploaded all basic programs  of C++ because basics programs are as similar as  the C Programs so in this repository i had mainly focus on the OOPs Concepts , so major programs you will get here will be from the OOPs concepts (i.e, from Classes onwards...).



## REQUEST -  PLEASE UNDERSTAND!!
Hey guys, all the program which is here is only to help students not to make them cheaters . I request you to please try it before atleast two times (try to build logic and think what the question ask) by self,if after your loyal effort,the logic not clicked then only come here and take this as a reference and after understanding it please try it again ,you will surely achieve success .

#
I had given the code file with name like p001.cpp , p002.cpp , p003.cpp .....so on , so you guys here take the reference which program is behind these names.


#### I had  provided output of the program  below in each program file  as comment for reference.

# LIST OF PROGRAMS

## Basics Program 

#### p001.cpp =    WAP to read 3 numbers and find its maximum
#
#### p002.cpp =    WAP to find Factorial of a number
#
#### p003.cpp =    WAP to read a number and counts a number of digits in it
#
#### p004.cpp =    WAP to swap 2 numbers using CALL BY VALUE
#
#### p005.cpp =    WAP to swap 2 numbers using CALL BY POINTERS
#
#### p006.cpp =    WAP to swap 2 numbers using CALL BY REFERENCE VARIABLE

##  Program based on Classes  ( OOPs )
#
#### p007.cpp =    WAP that demonstrate Default Arguments in C++
#
#### p008.cpp =    WAP  to check that number is prime or not
#
#### p009.cpp =    WAP to check that number is Armstrong Number or not
#
#### p010.cpp =    WAP to find sum of array element
#
#### p011.cpp =    WAP to develop Mini Calculator
#
#### p012.cpp =    WAP to perform matrix addition and subtraction by making matrix class
